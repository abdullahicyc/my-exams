# My Exams
**My first Android app** for students to track their final semester exams! Written in Java with Eclipse IDE.

I finished the project during the holiday after semester 4 exams (my second year in university).


## Running the app:
The app is [now published and live on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyc.app.myexams) ðŸš€ 
Or you can run the **RUN_ME.apk**.
